# Shipping SOP (excerpt)

## Expediting shipments
If a shipment is at risk of missing SLA, operations may request an expedite.
Steps:
1) Confirm shortage impact (SKU, DC, date)
2) Check inbound ETA and carrier status
3) If expedite is needed, open an expedite ticket and notify procurement
4) Document decision and cost impact
